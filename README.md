# MAP-CSI: Single-site Map-Assisted Localization Using Massive MIMO CSI

## Dataset
The dataset consists of (CSI, Location) pairs. This size of the CSI matrix of size NtxNc depends on the number of transmitters (Nt) and number of subcarriers (Nc).  
The dataset is generated from [ViWi Dataset](https://viwi-dataset.net/scenarios.html). In this project "Colocated camera with direct view" and "colocated camera with blocked view" sencarios are used for datageneration.  These two scenarios are referred to in the paper as "LOS dataset" and "Mixed dataset", respectively. 

## Questions
